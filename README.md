## USB sample rate changer for Android devices on the fly

Under Magisk environment ("root name space mount mode" must be changed to "global"), this script changes the sample rate of the USB audio class driver on Android devices on the fly like Bluetooth LDAC or Windows mixer. This script signals the audioserver on the "global" mount name space to try to reaload a USB audio policy configuration file generated by this script with a specified sample rate and bit depth, so the "root name space mount mode" change is needed.

* Usage: sh /sdcard/USB_SampleRate_Changer/USB_SampleRate_Changer.sh [[44k|48k|88k|96k|176k|192k|353k|384k|706k|768k] [[16|24|32]]]

  if you unpack the archive under "/sdcard" (Internal Storage). The arguments are a sample rate and a bit depth to which you like to change, respectively.
* Note: "USB_SampleRate_Changer.sh" requires to unlock the USB audio class driver's limitation (upto 96kHz lock) if you like to specify greater than 96kHz. See my companion magisk module ["usb-samplerate-unlocker"](https://github.com/yzyhk904/usb-samplerate-unlocker).

I recommend to use Script Manager or like for easiness.

## DISCLAIMER

* I am not responsible for any damage that may occur to your device, 
   so it is your own choice to attempt this script.
