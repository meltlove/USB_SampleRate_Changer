## USB (including a 3.5mm jack and an internal speaker) sample rate changer for Android devices on the fly

This mod is not a Magisk module but a collection of root shell scripts using Magisk su or phh's SuperUser, and can be installed by just unpacking its ZIP archive on your Internal Storage ("/sdcard") or another. Under Magisk environment (<strong>"root name space mount mode" must be changed to "global"</strong> in the settings of Magisk Manager), this script changes the sample rate of the USB (including hardware offloading) audio class driver on Android devices on the fly like the developer setting of Bluetooth LDAC or the Windows mixer for <q><em>avoiding annoying SRC (Sample Rate Conversion) distortion ultimately</em></q>. This script signals the audioserver on the "global" mount name space to try to reload an audio policy configuration file generated by this script with a specified sample rate and bit depth, so the "root name space mount mode" change is needed. <br/>
<br/>
Additionally, this script disables DRC (Dynamic Range Control, i.e., a kind of compression) if DRC has been enabled on a stock firmware. For example, smart phones and tablets whose SoC's have an SDM??? or SM???? model number usually enable DRC on all audio outputs, but those whose SoC's have an MT???? model number don't enable DRC on any audio output. <br/>
<br/>
Finally, the Android OS mixer (AudioFlinger) always apply resampling even to 1:1 ratio pass-through (e.g., 44.1kHz to 44.1kHz resampling with Kaiser windowed digital low pass filtering), so you need to be careful for resampling parameters even when resampling is not needed (see the description of "extras/change-resampling-quality.sh" below).

* Usage: `sh /sdcard/USB_SampleRate_Changer/USB_SampleRate_Changer.sh [--reset][--auto][--usb-only][--legacy][--offload][--bypass-offload][--safe][-safest] [--drc] [[44k|48k|88k|96k|176k|192k|353k|384k|706k|768k] [[16|24|32]]]`,

if you unpack the archive under "/sdcard" (Internal Storage). The arguments are a sample rate and a bit depth to which you want to change, respectively. Their default values are `44k` (sample rate: 44.1 kHz) and `32` (bit depth: 32 bits).

  - Options
    - `--reset`(without arguments): resets its previous execution results.
    - `--auto`: investigates device's environment and changes an audio policy configuration file appropriately in most situations. (default behavior)
    - `--usb-only`: changes a USB audio policy configuration file only.
    - `--legacy`: changes an audio policy configuration file for a Bluetooth audio legacy HAL (<em>/system/{lib,lib64}/hw/audio.a2dp.default.so</em>).
    - `--offload`: changes an audio policy configuration file for (USB & Bluetooth) hardware offloading. 
    - `--bypass-offload`: changes an audio policy configuration file for bypassing (USB & Bluetooth) hardware offloading and using a non- hardware offloading USB & Bluetooth audio driver while a 3.5mm jack and an internal speaker use a hardware offloading driver.
    - `--safe`: changes an audio policy configuration file for a Bluetooth audio legacy HAL but keeps considerably traditional settings for an internal speaker and others.
    - `--safest`: changes an audio policy configuration file for a Bluetooth audio legacy HAL but keeps most traditional settings for an internal speaker and others.
    - `--drc`: forces to enable DRC (Dynamic Range Control, i.e., compression) for the purpose of comparison to this script's usual DRC-less audio quality (not effective for --usb-only mode).

    - For typical example, `sh /sdcard/USB_SampleRate_Changer/USB_SampleRate_Changer.sh` automatically investigates your device and determines the audio policy configuration type ("offload" (including USB & Bluetooth), "bypass-offload" ("offload" except USB & Bluetooth), "legacy" ("bypass-offload" using a legacy Bluetooth module "a2dp"), "safe" (for non-offloading devices) and "safest" (for old devices). And this sets the sample rate and the bit depth of your device to be 44.1 kHz and 32 bits. If you want to set another sample rate and bit depth, please specify specific values.

    - I recommend using `sManager` (Script Manager) or the like for easiness (at boot automatic execution, saving many combinations of script options and parameters as aliases, and so on.

* Note 1: "USB_SampleRate_Changer.sh" requires unlocking the USB audio class driver's limitation (upto 96kHz lock or 384kHz offload lock) if you want to specify greater than 96kHz or 384kHz (in case of USB hardware offloading, i.e., maybe hardware offload tunneling). See my companion magisk module ["usb-samplerate-unlocker"](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Alt-Repo/usb-samplerate-unlocker) for non- hardware offload drivers. Although you specify a high sample rate for this script execution, you cannot connect your device to a USB DAC with the sample rate unless the USB DAC supports the sample rate (the USB driver will limit the connecting sample rate down to its maximum sample rate).

* Note 2: This script and other extras ones can be executed under "phh's SuperUser" root environment on recent A/B partition phh-GSI's. If you find some errors under the environment, try `setenforce 0` with root permission for making Selinux mode to be permissive. Some phh-GSI's have wrong selinux settings.

* Tips 1: You can see the sample rate connecting to a USB DAC during music replaying by a command `cat /proc/asound/card1/pcm0p/sub0/hw_params` (for non- USB hardware offload drivers). You can also see mixer ("AudioFlinger") info by a command `dumpsys media.audio_flinger`. There are corresponding convenient scripts ("alsa-hw-params.sh" and "dumpsys-filtered.sh") and others in "extras" folder.

  - Usage:  `sh /sdcard/USB_SampleRate_Changer/extras/alsa-hw-params.sh`
    - outputs information of the ALSA audio driver for USB DAC's, 3.5mm Jack and internal speakers.

  - Usage:  `sh /sdcard/USB_SampleRate_Changer/extras/dumpsys-filtered.sh [--all][--help]`
     - outputs active peripheral's information from `dumpsys media.audio_flinger`. With `--all` option, this script outputs all peripheral's information from the command.

  - Usage:  `sh /sdcard/USB_SampleRate_Changer/extras/getConfig.sh [--all][--help]`
    - outputs brief information of the active audio policy configuration. With `--all` option, this script outputs all the information of the configuration.

  - Usage:  `sh /sdcard/USB_SampleRate_Changer/extras/change_resampling_quality.sh [--help] [--status] [--reset] [--bypass] [--cheat] [stop_band_dB [half_filter_length [cut_off_percent]]]`
    - changes the resampling quality of the OS mixer (AudioFlinger). "--help" and "--status" options specify printing above usage and the status of AudioFlinger's resampling configuration without configuration changes, respectively. With "--reset" option, this script clears previous settings. "--bypass" option specifies to apply this configuration change except toward less than 48kHz (excluding 48kHz itself) frequencies. "--cheat" option specifies to switch the mode of third argument "cut_off_percent" (if specified) from "cut off" to "transition band cheat" (i.e., the middle point of a transition band). "stop_band_dB", "half_filter_length" and "cut off percent" specify a stop band attenuation in dB, the number of input data needed before the current point (optional) and a 3dB cut off (or a transition band width cheat) percent of the Nyquist frequency (optional), respectively. AOSP standard values are 90dB and 32 (cut off: 100%), but this script's default values are 160dB and 480 (cut off: 91%) as mastering quality values, i.e., no resampling distortion in a real sense (even though the 160dB targeted attenuation is not accomplished in the AOSP implementation).
    - Note: the resampler of the Android OS mixer is a pure Kaiser windowed Sinc interpolator (a 16 bit integer polyphase FIR filter and a 32bit one) that has 127 fixed phase sets of FIR coefficients generated from specified parameters and a variable phase set of FIR coeffcients linearly interpolated from other phase sets. So 2<sup>&#177;n</sup> (phases) type up-sampling and down-sampling are very precise.
    - Remark: the Android OS mixer always apply resampling even to 1:1 ratio pass-through, e.g., 44.1kHz to 44.1kHz pass-though. To be bit-perfect pass-through, you need to consider parameters carefully for making a Kaiser window to be one pulse under 16bit, 24bit or 32bit precision. With "--bypass" option, 1:1 ratio resampling from 44.1kHz & 16bit data to 44.1kHz 16bit one keeps bit-perfect (but not to 44.1kHz 24bit or 32bit one). I recommend using 194dB 520 (cut off: 100%) for 1:1 ratio resampling. The half filter length 520 can make an effective jitter buffer and reduce jitter to a certain extent. However this resampling makes audibly large aliasing distortion for none 1:1 ratio resampling under Android 11 or earlier because of an aliasing processing bug. For this reason, I also don't recommend specifying "cut off" and "cheat" around and over the Nyquist frequency under Android 11 or earlier.

* Tips 2: "jitter-reducer.sh" in "extras" folder is an interactive tool derived from ["Hifi Maximizer"](https://github.com/yzyhk904/hifi-maximizer-mod) which could reduce jitter distortions in all digital audio outputs relating to SELinux mode, thermal controls, CPU&GPU governors, camera server, I/O scheduling, virtual memory, wifi suspension and the audio effects framework (to interface to equalizers, virtualizers, visualizers, echo cancelers, automatic gain controls, etc.). In my opinion, jitter distortions reduction is the very key to ultimate hifi audio quality.

  - Usage:  `sh /sdcard/USB_SampleRate_Changer/extras/jitter-reducer.sh [--selinux|++selinux][--thermal|++thermal][---governor|++governor][--camera|++camera][--io [scheduler [light | m-light | medium | boost]] | ++io][--vm|++vm][--wifi|++wifi][--all|++all][--effect|++effect][--status][--help]`

    - each "--" prefixed option except "--status" and "--help" options is an enabler for its corresponding jitter reducer, conversely each "++" prefixed option is a disabler for its corresponding jitter reducer. "--all" option is an alias of all "--" prefixed options except "--effect", "--status" and "--help" options, and also "++all" option is an alias of all "++" prefixed options except "++effect".
    - "scheduler" specifies an I/O scheduler for I/O block devices (typically "deadline", "cfq" or "noop", but you may specify "*" for automatic best selection) and has optional four modes "light" (for warmer tone), "m-light" (for slightly warmer tone), "medium" (default) and "boost" (for clearer tone).
    - please remember that "--wifi" option is persistent even after reboot, but other options are not.

  - For most "hifi" example,  `sh /sdcard/USB_SampleRate_Changer/extras/jitter-reducer.sh --all --effect --status` enables all jitter reducers including effects framework one and outputs the jitter related statuses. For Bluetooth earphones, you may need to add `--io "*" boost` or `--io "*" m-light` option.  For DLNA transmitting, you may need to add `--io "*" boost` option. (If you use "AirMusic" to transmit audio data, I recommend setting around 4549 msec additional delay to reduce jitter distortion on the AirMusic panel to display target device(s).)

* Tips 3: Please disable "Manage apps automatically" in "Battery manager" (or "Adaptive battery" of "Adaptive preferences") in the battery section (needless to say, don't enable battery savers and the like), and change "Battery optimization" from "Optimize" to "Don't optimize" (or change "Battery usage" from "Optimized" to "Unrestricted") for following app's manually through the settings UI of Android OS (to lower less than 10Hz jitter making extremely short reverb or foggy sound like distortion). music (streaming) player apps, their licensing apps (if exist), "AirMusic" (if exists), "AirMusic  Recording Service" (system app; if exists), equalizer apps (if exist), "Bluetooth" (system app), "Bluetooth MIDI Service" (system app), "MTP Host" (system app), "NFC Service" (system app; if exists), "sManager" or the like (if exists), "Magisk" (if exists), System WebView apps (system app), Browser apps, "PhhTrebleApp" (system app; if exists), "Android Services Library" (system app), "Android Shared Library" (system app), "Android System" (system app), "System UI" (system app), "Input Devices" (system app), {Gesture, 3 Button, 2  Button} Navigation Bar apps (which you are using only; system app), "crDroid System" (system app; if exists), "LineageOS System" (system app; if exists), launcher app, "Google Play Store" (system app), "Google Play services" (system app), "Styles & wallpaper" or the like (system app), {Lineage, crDroid, Arrow, etc.} themes app (system app; if exists),  "AOSP panel" (system app; if exists), "OmniJaws" (system app; if exists), "OmniStyle" (system app; if exists), "Active Edge Service" (system app; if exists), "Android Device Security Module" (system app; if exists), "Call Management" (system app; if exists), "Phone" (system app; if exists), "Phone Calls" (system app; if exists), "Phone Services" (system app; if exists), "Phone and Messaging Storage" (system app; if exists), "Storage Manager" (system app), "Default" (system app; if exists), "Default StatusBar" (system app; if exists), "Wfd Service" (system app; if exists), "Wallpaper" or the like (system app), "Adreno Graphics Drivers" (system app; if exists), "com.android.providers.media" (system app), "Files by Google" (system app; if exists), "Google Play Services for AR" (system app; if exists), "Google Services Framework" (system app), camera apps, keyboard app, kernel adiutors (if exist), etc. And also Disable "Digital Wellbeing" (system app; if it exists) itself or change "Battery usage" from "Optimized" to "Unrestricted" (this is very harmful for audio like camera servers).

* Tips 4: See also my magisk module ["audio-misc-settings"](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Alt-Repo/audio-misc-settings). This can increase the number of media volume steps to 100 steps and so on.
